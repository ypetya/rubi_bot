Morphdb.hu is an open source morphological resource for Hungarian.

Morphdb.hu comprises of an extensive lexicon and a morphological grammar.

Resources use the description language HunLex morphological resource specification framework.

The resources are meant to be used with the HunLex preprocessor which produces resource formats that are read by the HunMorph word-analysis tools, such as spell-checker, stemmer, morphological analyzer/generator. 

Morphdb.hu is an attempt to reuse and unify various existing morphological
resources representing several decades of labour by linguists.
The base lexicon is a result of compiling the words of three existing dictionaries:
 - the Hungarian ispell/myspell (Magyar Ispell) dictionary, 
 - L.Elekfi's 'Dictionary of Hungarian Inflections' (this contains the words in Éksz.) 
 - Füredi-Kelemen-Papp Dictionary as compiled by Andras Kornai

Each of these dictionaries contained morphological information about 
their entries, however coded in different ways using rather different
concepts of morphological information. The main difficulty in merging
these resources was to harmonize and revise their information content 
as relevant to our morphological grammar with minimal information loss.

The morphdb.hu morphological grammar is an entirely original product of 
the project.

The morphdb.hu project is an ongoing development of these resources,
